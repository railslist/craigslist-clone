== Setup & Installation

Railslist can be installed either on a Webserver or locally (Desktop). Irrespective where you install, it is assumed that the target system is already installed with Ruby, Rails, MySQL and ImageMagick/RMagick (used for captcha). Go for Phusion Passenger, if you have a dedicated or semi-dedicated hosting. Passenger offers faster performance.

== Prerequisites
Apache, Ruby 1.8.6, Rails 2.2.2, RMagick/ImageMagick and MySQL / SQLite
(InstantRails for Desktop - comes with all the above except RMagick/ImageMagick)
If you are using Rails 2.3.3, then rename application.rb to application_controller.rb

== Installing on a Webserver

* Modify Database Connection settings (/public_html/config/database.yml), to point to your database.
* Goto database folder (/public_html/db) and run -- rake db:schema:load -- to create necessary tables in your db
* Change /public_html/config/initializers/siteconfig.rb - set SITENAME = "yoursitename" & SITEURL = "http://www.yoursite.com"
